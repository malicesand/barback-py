Sync and sort directory labels according to exif data. 

### Built for Tales of the Cocktail 2025 official photo team

1. Reads metadata with exiftool
2. Compares and renames folders accordingly with awkk
3. Uses Automator to rename folders with a trigger of an event in PhotoMechanic
4. Interfaces with PhotoMechanic to sort files according to team's file hierarchy

### Integration with App Scripts
- Attached .gs file includes scripts for automating phototeams scheduling data
- written originally in the App Script editor
- Done in five days without a linter or version control. Would not recommend.
